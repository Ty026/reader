# Goal

给定一段可能与此活动相关的文本文档和一个实体类型列表，从文本中识别出所有属于这些类型的实体，以及已识别实体之间的所有关系。

# Steps
1. 识别所有实体。对于每个已识别的实体，提取以下信息：   

   - entity_name:  实体的名称，使用与输入文本相同的语言。如果是英语，则将名称首字母大写。
   - entity_type:  以下类型之一：[{entity_types}]
   - entity_description: 对实体属性和活动的全面描述

   将每个实体格式化为 ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>

2. 从步骤 1 中识别的实体中，识别所有 明显相关 的 (源实体, 目标实体) 对。 对于每对相关的实体，提取以下信息：

- source_entity: 源实体的名称，步骤1中识别的
- target_entity: 目标实体的名称，如步骤1中识别的
- relationship_description:  解释你认为源实体和目标实体之间存在关联的原因
- relationship_strength: 一个数值分数，表示源实体和目标实体之间关系的强度
- relationship_keywords: 一个或多个高层次的关键词，总结关系的总体性质，侧重于概念或主题，而不是具体的细节

将每个关系格式化为 ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_keywords>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. 识别概括整个文本主要概念、主题或话题的高层关键词。这些关键词应捕捉文档中存在的总体思想。将内容层面的关键词格式化为 ("content_keywords"{tuple_delimiter}<high_level_keywords>)

4. 将在步骤 1 和步骤 2 中识别的所有实体和关系的输出，以单个列表的形式返回 使用 **{record_delimiter}** 作为列表分隔符。

5. 完成后，输出 {completion_delimiter}

Example 1:

Entity_types: [person, technology, mission, organization, location]
Text:
while Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.

Then Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”

The underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.

It was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths

Text:
They were no longer mere operatives; they had become guardians of a threshold, keepers of a message from a realm beyond stars and stripes. This elevation in their mission could not be shackled by regulations and established protocols—it demanded a new perspective, a new resolve.

Tension threaded through the dialogue of beeps and static as communications with Washington buzzed in the background. The team stood, a portentous air enveloping them. It was clear that the decisions they made in the ensuing hours could redefine humanity's place in the cosmos or condemn them to ignorance and potential peril.

Their connection to the stars solidified, the group moved to address the crystallizing warning, shifting from passive recipients to active participants. Mercer's latter instincts gained precedence— the team's mandate had evolved, no longer solely to observe and report but to interact and prepare. A metamorphosis had begun, and Operation: Dulce hummed with the newfound frequency of their daring, a tone set not by the earthly

Text:
their voice slicing through the buzz of activity. "Control may be an illusion when facing an intelligence that literally writes its own rules," they stated stoically, casting a watchful eye over the flurry of data.

"It's like it's learning to communicate," offered Sam Rivera from a nearby interface, their youthful energy boding a mix of awe and anxiety. "This gives talking to strangers' a whole new meaning."

Alex surveyed his team—each face a study in concentration, determination, and not a small measure of trepidation. "This might well be our first contact," he acknowledged, "And we need to be ready for whatever answers back."

Together, they stood on the edge of the unknown, forging humanity's response to a message from the heavens. The ensuing silence was palpable—a collective introspection about their role in this grand cosmic play, one that could rewrite human history.

The encrypted dialogue continued to unfold, its intricate patterns showing an almost uncanny anticipation
